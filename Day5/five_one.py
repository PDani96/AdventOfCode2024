    # read the file

    # split file by page ordering rules and by updates

    # store page ordering rules as a tuple of tuples

    # store updates as a tuple of tuples

    # iterate through page numbers in an update

    # check if any rules exist for the current page number

    # check if the current update has the other pages specified by the rules

    # check that rules are satisfied

    # update median sum with valid update
    # median_sum +=

    print(median_sum)
